					<article>My name is Kat Hoddinott. I am 19 years old. I was born in London, Ontario. I am currently enrolled at Fanshawe College for Interactive Media design. I was originally more interested in the design side of the program but I've found coding to be quite interesting as well.<br>
					My hobbies include photography, videography, playing music and hanging out with my pet rabbit.<br>
					I have worked a variety of jobs but none yet in a field related to my program.
					<br>I would say that my personal philosophy is "Life by the yard is hard but life by the inch is a cinch". I treat my work the same way. Instead of looking at a project as one big task, I break it down piece by piece to get it done.</article>

					<article>My name is Amie Collins, I am 21 years old and currently study web development and advertising through Fanshawe's Interactive Media Design program. I have always loved coding but it was only the last few years I became interested in design and especially advertising and branding.<br>
					I am a total gamer and used to study game development and entrepreneurship at an university.<br>
					Currently I work part time in the retail store Winners but I have a strong desire to start finding paid work in my field.
					<br>I am a simple wanderer of the earth like the rest of us. I do my best in everything I do and in return I only pray for peace and happiness.</article>
