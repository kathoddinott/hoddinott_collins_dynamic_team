					<article>My name is Kat Hoddinott. I am 19 years old. I was born in London, Ontario. I am currently enrolled at Fanshawe College for Interactive Media design. I was originally more interested in the design side of the program but I've found coding to be quite interesting as well.<br>
					My hobbies include photography, videography, playing music and hanging out with my pet rabbit.<br>
					I have worked a variety of jobs but none yet in a field related to my program.
					<br>I would say that my personal philosophy is "Life by the yard is hard but life by the inch is a cinch". I treat my work the same way. Instead of looking at a project as one big task, I break it down piece by piece to get it done.</article>
